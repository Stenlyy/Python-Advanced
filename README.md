<h1>About the Course</h1>
<p>The "Python Advanced" course builds upon the skills for working with the Python language, focusing on more complex
    concepts typical for the language. In the course, participants will learn to create linear data structures, solve
    algorithmic problems (problem-solving skills), and work with stacks and queues, tuples and sets, multidimensional
    lists, as well as files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. Recursive
    functions and functions with multiple arguments will be explored in depth. The development environment used by the
    training team will be PyCharm, but each participant is free to use tools of their preference.</p>
